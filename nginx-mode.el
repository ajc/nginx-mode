;;; Commentary:

;; This is a quick mode for editing Nginx config files, as I didn't find
;; anything else around that did quite this much.

;; Many thanks to the authors of puppet-mode.el, from where I found a
;; useful indentation function that I've modified to suit this situation.

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'nginx-mode)
